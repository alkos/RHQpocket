Testbed to create an application for Andorid(TM)-based devices
as management frontend for RHQ (http://rhq-project.org/).

Currently it needs the heiko-rest branch from RHQ source. See
http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=rhq/rhq.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/heiko-rest
Using that branch (which is not production ready at all), will require
a container rebuild, as additional libraries need to be added to the
container.

Classes in org.rhq.core.domain are copied over manually
and the JaxB Annotations are stripped off (if needed )
as Android can not (directly) use JAXB classes.
